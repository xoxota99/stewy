# Examples Directory

This directory contains example applications and usage demonstrations for the Stewy project. Each example focuses on a specific aspect of the system.

## Available Examples

- `BasicMovement/`: Demonstrates basic platform movement using the Platform class
  - Shows how to initialize the platform and move it to different positions
  - Includes examples of pitch, roll, and combined movements

- `TouchscreenCalibration/`: Demonstrates the touchscreen calibration process
  - Shows how to initialize and calibrate the touchscreen
  - Includes visualization of touchscreen data

## Planned Examples

The following examples are planned for future development:

- Nunchuck control demonstration
- PID tuning examples
- Mode demonstrations (CIRCLE, EIGHT, SQUARE)

## Usage

Each example is a standalone application that can be compiled and uploaded to the Teensy board. To use an example:

1. Open the example directory in PlatformIO
2. Build and upload the example to your Teensy
3. Follow the instructions in the example's comments

Note that some examples may require specific hardware components to be connected (e.g., touchscreen, nunchuck).
